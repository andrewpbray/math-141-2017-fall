# Honest Liars | An introduction to Conditional Probability

## The context

<img src="../figs/employee-theft.png" alt="theft" width="750">

## Problem Set-up

- Through accounting procedures, it is known that 10% of the employees of a store are stealing.

- This classroom will act as employees and two managers.

## The managers

- First, we need two managers.

    ```{r managers, tidy=TRUE}
    students <- 1:26
    ```

-
    ```{r}
    sample(students, size = 2)
    ```

- The rest of you are the employees.

## The employees

You will need two random digits.

>- Digit 1: Last digit of your Reed ID #
>- Digit 2: 5th digit of your phone num (excluding area code)

Please write these on a sheet of paper.

## Honest or thief?

To simulate 10% of retail employees being thieves, we will use your first random digit:

- If your first digit = 0, write "thief" above your first number.
- Otherwise, write "honest" above your first number.


## Pass or fail? {.build}

Your manager now administers a lie detector test that is 80% accurate;
there is an 80% chance that thieves will fail the test and an 80% chance that 
honest folk will pass the test. 

Using your second random digit,

- Thieves
    - If your digit = 0 or 1, write "pass" above that digit.
    - Otherwise, write "fail" above that digit.
- Honest folk
    - If your digit = 0 or 1, write "fail" above that digit.
    - Otherwise, write "pass" above that digit.
    
    
## Moment of truth

- Who wrote "fail" on their piece of paper?  Raise your hands.

- Managers:  What percentage of these employees do you think are thieves?

- Those that raised their hands/failed the test, state whether you are honest or a thief.

- What happened here?
    - The well-known fallacy of reversing the conditional probability!
