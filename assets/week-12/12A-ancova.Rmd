When you buy a book off of Amazon, you get a quote for how much it
costs to ship. This is based on the weight of the book. If you
didn't know the weight a book, what other characteristics of it
could you measure to help predict weight?

```{r getdata, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DAAG)
data(allbacks)
books <- allbacks[, c(3, 1, 4)]
```


## Example: shipping books
```{r plotallbacks}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, data = books)
```


## Example: shipping books {.smaller}

```{r fitm1, echo = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(weight ~ volume, data = books)
```

```{r plotallbackswline}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, data = books) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = m1$coef[1], slope = m1$coef[2], col = "orchid")
```


## Fitting the linear model {.build .smaller}

```{r}
m1 <- lm(weight ~ volume, data = books)
summary(m1)
```

### Q1: What is the equation for the line?

$$ \hat{y} = 107.7 + 0.708 x $$
$$ \widehat{weight} = 107.7 + 0.708 volume $$


## {.build}

Q2: Does this appear to be a reasonable setting to apply linear regression?

We need to check:

1. Linear trend
2. Independent observations
3. Normal residuals
4. Equal variance


## Residual Plot

```{r resplot}
qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m1)
```


## QQ plot

```{r resplot2, warning=FALSE}
qplot(sample = .stdresid, data = m1, stat = "qq") +
  geom_abline()
```


## {.build .smaller}

### Q3: Is volume a significant predictor?

```{r sumtable}
summary(m1)
```

Q4: How much of the variation in weight is explained by the model containing volume?


## Multiple Regression {.build}

Allows us create a model to explain one $numerical$ variable, the response, as a linear function of many explanatory variables that can be both $numerical$ and
$categorical$.

We posit the true model:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon; \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) $$

We use the data to estimate our fitted model:

$$ \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + \ldots + b_p X_p $$


## Estimating $\beta_0, \beta_1$ etc.

In least-squares regression, we're still finding the estimates that minimize
the sum of squared residuals.

$$ e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i $$

$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2 $$

And yes, they have a closed-form solution.

$$ \mathbf{b} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y $$

In R:
```{r eval = FALSE}
lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + Xp, data = mydata)
```



## Example: shipping books {.build}

```{r plotcolors}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books)
```


## Example: shipping books {.build .smaller}

```{r}
m2 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover, data = books)
summary(m2)
```

### How do we interpret these estimates?


#


## Example: shipping books {.build .smaller}

```{r echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1] + m2$coef[3], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 4)
```


## MLR slope interpretation {.build}

The slope corresponding to the dummy variable tell us:

- How much vertical separation there is between our lines
- How much `weight` is expected to increase if `cover` goes
from 0 to 1 and `volume` is left unchanged.

Each $b_i$ tells you how much you expect the $Y$ to change when you change the
$X_i$, while **holding all other variables constant**.


## {.smaller .build}

```{r}
summary(m2)
```

- Is the difference between cover types significant?
- How much of the variation in weight is explained by a model containing both
volume and cover?


##

```{r}
summary(m2)$coef
qt(.025, df = nrow(books) - 3)
```

Which of the follow represents the appropriate 95% CI for `coverpb`?

1. $197 \pm 1.96 \times 59.19$
2. $-184 \pm 2.18 \times 40.5$
3. $-184 \pm -4.55 \times 40.5$


## Extending the model

```{r echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1] + m2$coef[3], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 4)
```

The two cover types have different intercepts. Do they share the same slope?


#


## Extending the model

```{r echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


## {.smaller .build}

```{r}
m3 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover + volume:cover, data = books)
summary(m3)
```

Do we have evidence that two types of books have different relationships
between volume and weight?


## Take home messages {.build}

- There is a statistically significant relationship between volume and weight.
- There is a statistically significant difference in weight between paperback
and hardcover books, when controlling for volume.
- There is no strong evidence that the relationship between volume and weight
differs betwen paperbacks and hardbacks.

This is **inference**, which required **valid models**. We'll check diagnostics 
next time.
